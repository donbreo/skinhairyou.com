					<div id="hair_transplant">
					<h4 >Hair Transplant (FUE)</h4>
					<p>
						FUE is one of the most modern and scientific technique for hair restoration. 
						It is a scarless, stitch less and painless procedure in which grafted 
						follicular units are transplanted in the affected area. A hair transplant surgeon normally 
						repeats the treatment until adequate follicular units are harvested on the scalp. You can opt for this
						innovative treatment to cure graying and thinning hair, severe dandruff, bald patches on the scalp 
						(alopecia areata) and also a flaky scalp. At Skin, Hair & You, we have the experts who leverage their
						impeccable knowledge and experience to execute this process with ultimate ease for best results.

					<div id="nail_disorder">
					<h4 >Nail Disorder</h4>
					<p>
						Some of the most commonly occurring nail disorders include fungal infections, warts, ingrown nails, etc.
						Diseases like psoriasis or lichen plants may also cause the nails to become brittle with time. Also, 
						excessive nail polish, manicures or pedicures and vanish or cosmetics can damage your sensitive nails.
						Our professionals will first examine your nails, determine the extent of infection and then recommend the proper course of treatment. 
						We also offer nail avulsion surgery for severe or returning fungal infections. 
					</p>
					</div>
					<div  id="std">
					<h4>STD/HIV</h4>
					<p>
						Unsafe sex can often lead to some troublesome diseases, more widely known as Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)
						or even HIV in worst case scenarios. These diseases can cause various distressing symptoms to patients which might
						result in a bad skin or long-lasting effects on your skin or hair. Some of the common symptoms include itching or redness
						in the genital area, rashes or ulcers in the genital area and others. Especially in the case of HIV, skin conditions like rashes,
						lesions or sores can be the early signs of the disease in the body. These can be either general dermatitis, 
						bacterial or viral infections or skin tumours. Such conditions require immediate attention and counselling and thus, 
						at Skin, Hair & You, we offer end to end treatment solutions for any kind of skin problems associated with these diseases.
						We also provide HIV screening and sexual dysfunctional counselling at affordable costs. 
					</p>
					</div>
					<div id="skin_disorders">
					<h4 >Skin Disorders</h4>
					<p>
						Skin is the biggest organ of our body and extends even deeper than the visible peripheral layers we see. 
						For this reason, many skin diseases tend to have deep rooted causes, thus demanding more penetrative medications and treatment 
						solutions. Some of the common skin disorders can include rashes, eczema, acne, whiteheads, hives, blemishes, psoriasis, and many more.
						It can range from just a mild irritation due to some allergy to severe problems or even permanent scarring.
						At Skin, Hair & You, our experts have the knowledge and skills to diagnose the exact cause of your skin disorder 
						and chalk out the right treatment plan based on your age and skin type. 
						You can also opt for our signature facial rejuvenation with Botox, Dermal Fillers, facial peels or skin tightening. Whether you need 
						a face lift to look young and vibrant or want to get rid of the fine lines and wrinkles on your skin, trust us to handle all 
						your skin problems with expert care. 
						You can be assured of a glowing and clear skin post your treatment and look forward to a healthier skin in the future.

					<h4>FACIAL CLEANSING</h4>
					<p>
					A common benefit of facial cleansing is the removal of dirt, oil, and other unwanted debris. 
					Throughout the day the skin on your face is continually covered with bacteria, pollutants, viruses, dirt, 
					and old (dead) skin cells. Daily facial washing removes these impurities to give the skin a fresh look. 
					Without washing, your skin would be covered with a thick layer of dirt and grime which make it difficult 
					for other products to penetrate the skin properly.<br/>
					<b>BOOSTING HYDRATION</b><br/>
					Regular facial cleansing (along with the use of a good moisturizer) is also an important factor in helping the skin maintain a
					proper level of hydration. Dehydrated skin looks and feels rough, wrinkled and aged.
					Cleansing helps manage PH levels of the skin; enabling sufficient water and product retention.<br/>
					<b>WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU STOPPED CLEANSING?</b><br/>
					If you completely stopped washing your face your pores would become clogged resulting in the development of serious acne. 
					The skin could also experience a combination of severe redness, dryness and irritation from insufficient hydration. 
					Finally your skin would generally appear dirty, oily, greasy and significantly aged.<br/>
					Most likely you would develop an incredible itchiness; to the point where you would be forced to constantly 
					scratch your face. This could lead to breaks of the skin which serve as entry points for infection. <br/>
					Moral of the story: practice proper skin cleansing!<br/>
					<b>SOME OTHER BENEFITS OF CLEANSING</b><br/>
					Regular cleansing is essential to keeping your skin looking radiant and healthy.<br/>
					Cleansing helps anti-aging products and treatments work properly.<br/>
					Cleansing helps maintain proper pore size.<br/>
					Cleansing encourages proper skin hydration and prevents the production of excess oils.<br/>
					<b>HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT FACIAL CLEANSERS</b>
					Know your skin type and choose a cleanser that's a good match.
					If you have dry skin you'll want to avoid cleansers with high alcohol content.
					People with oily skin need a cleanser with a lower PH level. 
					For sensitive skin you'll want a basic cleanser free from heavy fragrance and additives.<br/>
					The delivery type of the cleanser matters. Cream based cleansers are great for dry skin while gel or foamy cleansers are better for oily skin types.<br/>
					Most cleansers marketed as "gentle" are great at removing dirt without over drying and irritating the skin.<br/>
					Selecting a cleanser with a balanced PH will help maintain your skins natural balance.<br/>
					Consult Skin Hair and You Clinic at Borivali East Siddharth Nagar and solve any Skin problems you may have.
